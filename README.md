# ISEL-Aprendizadem-E-Mineracao-De-Dados
Cadeira de mestrado com o objetivo de aprender técnicas de data mining e machine learning.


The medical center “MedKnow” uses a database management system (DBMS) that contains all the data 
gathered, throughout time, about each patient’s visit to a doctor (that works at “MedKnow”). The current goal of the 
ophthalmology team is to analyze all the information accumulated (throughout time) in order to extract the patterns 
that provide useful indicators to support the prescription (and diagnosis) activity. To achieve that goal they decided to 
contact the “SoftKnow” company and to send them the file “d01_lenses.xls” with a data snippet (related with the 
lenses prescription activity) and, in a line, they wrote the following challenge: “send us a prototype of a system that 
would provide “MedKnow” not only the operational (daily-work) support but also the strategic perspective (useful 
patterns) that can be extracted from that daily-work data”
